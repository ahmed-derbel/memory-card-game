### functionality:
This Memory Game has a lot of things to work on as a Developer. Here are few things you can look around in my web app:

You'd have sure played Memory Game (or Matching Game) in your childhood, and these are the same with more advanced functionality.

Shuffling Cards: Whenever you win the game and try again to play or click the restart button, the cards shuffles and all features such as timer , number of moves and star rating get back to the initial state

Matching Check: Matching is completely restricted to two cards at a time, and No other card is selected when two cards is being matched.

Extra Features: There is a timer, star rating and Moves count for your skill check on this game.

timer: timer will only get started after your first try (that means the first two cards that you reveal) be it a wrong or right doesn't matter


### known issues:
clicking so fast on cards can maybe sometime cause a small bug if smth like that happend just click the restart button , though i worked hard to prevent smth like that it still sometime just happens, and i'll keep working on the code and updating it for better performance
